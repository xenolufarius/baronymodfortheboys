I will post the files needed for the newest mods. For the .exe files, you must rename it to barony.exe and replace the .exe file in
the directory:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Barony, or wherever your steam games are on your computer.

You should also delete the DAT files in that same directory. The two files in question are the scores.DAT and scores_multiplayer.DAT files.
These can prevent you from launching the game when you replace the .exe file, so delete them.

For the .vox and .png files, you must replace them in the steam folder:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Barony
For now these only include the lockbox .vox file and the en language file. Both are in the lockbox mod folder here.
You can download both individually and replace them in their respective places, such as the models/items folder and lang folder, respectively.

However, I recommend just downloading the folders I have in there whole. Dropping these two folders, the models/items and lang folder, in the directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Barony where the .exe and other sure files are will replace automatically replace those files for you :)

You can ignore the lockpick (lockbox).vox and lockpick (OG).vox files, and only download the folders in the lockbox mod folder.
