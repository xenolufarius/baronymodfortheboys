I will post the files needed for the newest mods. For the .exe files, you must rename it to barony.exe

For the .vox and .png files, you must replace them in the steam folder:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Barony

For the .vox files, insert them into the models folder in the appropriate category, for example: for the lockbox model,
replace the lockpick model in the items folder in the models folder \Barony\models\items

For the .png files, do the same but in the images folder in the items folder \Barony\items\images
